☆hi y'all☆<!-- <br>from isolating in our apartments to taking to the streets, 2020 has ppl fighting for their lives in all the ways. there is a chasm between those gathering sans mask hitting the club & those in the streets masked up fighting for justice and for a future beyond just liberation. for those whose safety is chronically in jeopardy, the polarizing effects of the time has brought allegiances into the light (but as if we didn't already know). if you could imagine where these allegiances lie on a spectrum, those on the farthest end engaging actively in violence against Black, brown & indigenous communities through policing, incarceration, siphoning of resources, uneven distribution of social services, all of which contribute very actively to not only the death of, but a slow, deep violence towards these communities. let's say we put derek chauvin on that end, one who's white supremacist violence not only stands for itself but who's profession is descendent from slavehandlers. we then have along the spectrum those who commit for example: the hoarding of personal wealth, the counter-insurgency conversations of reform and of shifting of money around, we have those who's passivity, ignorance, and complicity speaks for itself, those who think there are good cops and good work to be done within the system. all of these manifestations are along a spectrum of different ways to be anti-Black.
<br><br>
the explicit violence of a chokehold or a knee to the neck, is an extension of calls for reform of policing & incarceration, both of which thru different means reinforce a state that at it's very foundation is anti-Black.  it seeps into every facet, you can trace it's stains thru ameriKKKa's history.  
<br><br> -->
<br>
the worlds we want to live in are already with us, housed in our practices of abolition. and as we care for one another thru mutual aid, self-organization, & community accountability, there’s some things that need to burn along the way. 
<br>
<!-- there can be no reform for a system who's bricks were laid by slaves and who's land it sleeps on was stolen. the layers of blood between the bricks of this country's foundation cannot be washed away. --> abolish the white supremacist state ♪( ´θ｀)
