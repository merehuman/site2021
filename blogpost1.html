			<h2>blog post1 abt important Thoughts & Feelings</h2>

		☆hello people&respective machines☆<br>
i've decided that a blog where other humans can choose if they want to consume what i expel into the void is better than inhabiting social platforms for the time being. so i will be posting a web of thoughts/projects/in progress work into the mindscape from time to time. thanks for coming xo
<br><br>
<strong>10/20</strong><br>
wanted to talk through the development of a few projects that i'm working on here & blast a few things that i'm excited by recently. 
<br><br>
★lately, i've been dedicating a lot of time to my work for stephanie dinkins, a super smart artist & thinker. i've been working with her for several months now on a project called "not the only one". 
<a class="link1" href="https://walkerart.org/magazine/2018-the-year-according-to-stephanie-dinkins">stephanie</a> has developed an AI chatbot that acts as an archive of her, her aunt, and her niece's experiences as a Black family in America (it's only been trained/developed by them and other POC). through this project and her other work, stephanie is making very clear to the white, male dominated tech world that <strong>technology is always a reflection of those who create it</strong>. her work encourages a wide scope of critical thought, but mainly, for me anyways, it's lays out very clearly that technology is always already racially biased (due to those that populate the yucky techworld/ultimate money-making machine), among other things. stephanie's work is important in shifting away from this.<br><br>
my work with stephanie has been to develop a virtual face for the AI chatbot, and to create a link between the output of the AI to it's three dimensional iteration. hopefully the outcome of this work is to be able to speak face to face, so to speak, with the three dimensional AI, and have a realtime conversation. i'm not sure how much of this i'm supposed to keep secret, so i won't go into specifics about how we're doing this.<br><br>
but i've been in research mode lately trying to figure out a successful workflow that allows for a text to speech translation that is mapped out live onto the facial rig of the 3D model. there isn't any softwares on the market that allow for this kind of fully integrated, live translation, but one exciting research center that we've been learning a lot from is the laboratory of animate technologies in auckland. they've developed this AI <a class="link1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNWjKtVWToc">baby</a>, that is housed in an integrated software with it's neural net, etc.. 
<br><br>
★i've also been making good progress on this virtual reality project, mapavr. i won't talk much about it here because i have a link to our devlog on my home page where we're posting regular updates. one exciting thing to note though is that we're potentially partnering up with this company called pison to make the virtual reality experience accessible to people with a limited range of mobility!
<br><br>
★personally, i've been in big time gamedev mode. i'm sketching out a game rn in this application called <a class="link1" href="https://twinery.org/">twine</a>, which is mainly used to make text based games. i use it specifically to tease out narratives, scripts, anticipate player interactions/decision-making. it works like a mindmap sort of, which is a format that i'm obsessed with. can't blast this app enough!<br>
<p>

</p>
i'm trying to make a bunch of game iterations around this larger umbrella concept that is situated in the inter-infrastructure devlog. simply put, the game(s) are about the ways in which the built environment prescribes social relations. ecology baby! the narrative i'm working through is taking the form of speculative fiction/poetry prose, which has been really fun and immersive to write. i've created this world that i find bleeding into my life in strange ways. one of the things that i've been paying a lot of attention to is the ways in which we use our bodies to interact with built structures & how these structures obligate us to engage with them in specific ways. this as a larger concept is one of the reasons why i was so immediately fascinated by stephanie's work, built structures make assumptions & these are assumptions made by someone at some point during the design process. if someone who falls into the category of a 'normal body', aka white, male, middle class, able bodied, able minded, is making assumptions about how other humans move through space and interact with it, those assumptions are def going to be biased to their lived reality. there are many examples (which i will post in the my heart moves faster devlog at some point) currently & throughout history of built environments being designed by communities, not individuals, & imo we gotta collectively adopt this. this game is explores that notion, and imagines a future in which the development of our environments is a collective process. i want to breed a possible future that is situated and caring. we gotta be invested in each other's flourishing!
<br><br> 
★a community-related recent development is that we're going to be hosting another community presentation series at the ear next month (which i will also post a link to in the mindscape at some point...). this one is being organized by <a class="link1" href="https://vijaymasharani.com/">vijay masharani</a>, a dear friend & brilliant artist and writer. vijay has a lot of cool projects on the go right now, so make sure he's on yr radar<3
<br><br>
★another thing that i'm so excited to blast is my domestic partner, sydney spann, just released an album with james k's label, zherocks. it's called <a class="link1" href="https://sunatirene0.bandcamp.com/album/queen-sound">queen sound</a> & was aptly described as somewhere in between broadcast and the breath of the wild soundtrack. 
<br><br>
★in terms of upcoming game releases, i'm very excited about colestia's, <a class="link1" href="https://colestia.itch.io/they-came-from-a-communist-planet">they came from a communist planet</a>, and lily zone's <a class="link1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_WZrAh6S00">crypt underworld</a>.
<br><br>
★lastly, this><a class="link1" href="https://landscapesfromanother.world/">landscapes from another world</a>
is my favorite blog rn other than my blog lol. <a class="link1" href="http://serafinalvarez.net/">serafin alvarez</a> is a real genius human imo & has a lot of cool blogs/projects.
<br><br><br>
