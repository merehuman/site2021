		  this project is a long form text-based game (for now) built with twine, that is concerned with speculative architecture & built environments. the game is experienced in first person as you navigate several different built environments, or "clumps", that have responded in varying ways to a unanimously enveloping, physical haze that has settled over all colonized space. each clump is collectively designed by the communities that inhabit them, architecturally & socially. 
  		  <br><br>

		there are so far 5 clumps, and they are as follows: <br>

		★in one clump someone invented eyeglasses to see through fog particles, & their community places a lot of value on artistic expression through physical objects (public art, architecture). their spaces are tall and sharp (no need for eyes to adjust from the roundness of the fog).<br>

		★in one clump they have built underground to avoid the haze & have built a tunnel system. as underground has been minimally colonized they live fairly peacefully with no disputes over land or property. they eat mainly bugs & siphon water from underground water tables & have no need for currency as nothing is scarce.<br>

		★in one clump the inhabitants have developed advanced auditory capabilities as a means to navigate & communicate through the haze. they keep to themselves as a symptom of relying on limited background noise to be aware of their surroundings. they are very courteous with public space & are well equipped to set boundaries & hold each other accountable to them.<br>

		★in one clump they have developed a way to control the shape of the haze & they use it to deliminate spatial boundaries. it acts architecturally as well as protectively. they are free to manipulate spatial needs for the community whenever necessary, & any member of the community can create whatever space suits them. there is no industry here, as the ability to manipulate the haze fits most material needs. <br>

		★in one clump they have built their environment high up in the sky, it is said above the haze line. but from there, there is still only haze to see. their resources are more scarce, and they have developed currency because of it.<br><br>

		if u have any feedback on this project as per the provided information i would love to hear it :) it is very dear to my heart & has been in the works for years!<br><br>
