☆hello fellow humans☆<br>a brief update on what i've been working on/thinking about/freaking out about! 
<br><br>
★the past couple of months have been tumultuous & intense. my brain & heart have been wrapped up in the experiences of those that i surround myself with. because of this, i haven't been that preoccupied with my personal practice, other than pretty consistently writing (partially parsing through larger concepts that i'm exploring while also building up this fictional world that my game is housed in). this world that i'm speculating about is shrouded in a blur that i've started to dream with. sharpness is an illusion of cognition, in a disabilities sense & an epistemological sense. seeing things clearly is not reflective of comprehension. i've been trying not to perceive built things for how acute they appear to be, and in my dreams i tend to forget some of the naturalizations of relations, things that should have settled in me. i keep getting lost in my dreams, literally like i lose my way, i lose track of the narrative, find myself confused about what i'm supposed to be doing, how i'm supposed to act. everything is either blurry or so sharp that it incises my eyes when i try to examine it's edges. 
<br>
★i've been spending so much time thinking around universalisms, ontologically and epistemologically, that it makes sense that i've been getting lost. the script that i'm writing parses universalisms, questions their intentions, tries to understand how they came to be by tracing the hands that built them. particular things with softer edges that blur into other things is what i'm interested in. and particularly i'm thinking about how spaces are constructed, how the structures that house us might not be for 'us'. there's no room to seep into each other. anyways i cryptically digress, the script is a narrative exploration of a speculative architecture project i'm working on that allows communities to develop into clumps via voluntary association & self organization. i will release the script on here in the coming months as a text-based game with sound design by sydney spann. <br><br>

★i've read some really amazing pieces of writing lately that have been informing my life & my research, most notably the ravicka series by renee gladman, para-platforms: on the spatial politics of right-wing populism, perhaps it is high time for a xeno-architecture to match, pattern discrimination, architecture in black by darell wayne fields, a hacker manifesto by mckenzie wark, black and blur by fred moten, an apartment on uranus by paul b preciado, psycho nymph exile by porpentine heartscape, fledgling by octavia butler, & forthcoming still but keep your eyes & ears peeled for, my friend tessa bolsover's manuscript the riblike instrument, and vijay masharani's considering the cultural boycott after kanders.
<br><br>
★i've also started organizing a queer gaming group that meets to play together & think together & archive qtipoc games :) there's a link to it in the mindscape so i won't reiterate but wow it feels so nice to develop this network!
<br><br>
★you know how everyone has been posting those spotify rewind 2019 big data tracking mood skewers? here's my version:

<br>
★i've been thinking about these past months as distinct, & think a more appropriate sumation of my year has to be what shattered my heart in 2019 & who/what has been picking up those millions of pieces to build me back up into something different. you know how when you break a bone you can poke at it under your skin after it's 'healed' & feel the uneven lumps of scar tissue? i feel this all over me, partially because i'm very clumsy & don't have fast enough reflexes to duck when a baseball is being thrown at my face, and partially because allowing yourself to heal unevenly is necessary sometimes. things always feel misaligned to me anyways. the uneven sedimentation of experience needs to be chipped away at, broken into many pieces, & reassembled with some patchy affixings. i started off 2019 having just returned to new york after having been deported (wrongfully) and now i'm still picking up the pieces and accidentally dropping them over & over again, but i have more hands helping me pick them back up now. y'all know who you are because i won't shut up about it when i'm in love, but a general reminder that your subjective existence can always be collectively conjugated. hold onto each other tightly. 
<br><br>
★one last note is something impactful that's been going on in new york recently (but within a larger global narrative of protest re. the recent protests in chile, millions taking to the streets in lebanon right now, and ongoing struggles in palestine, bolivia, sudan, the list goes on). there has been a wave of collective momentum surrounding the ongoing police presence & violence in the mta public transit system (the mta is actually a private company gag). there has been two large scale actions organized by why accountability, take back the bronx, <a class="link1" href="https://www.decolonizethisplace.org/">decolonize this place</a>, <a class="link1" href="https://www.nonewjails.nyc/background">no new jails nyc</a> & others forming the ftp coalition. the last one occupied the streets of harlem with over 3000 bodies that screamed an abolitionist agenda. if you're reading this & live in new york i urge you to support the work that these organizations are doing, the criminalization of poverty and of black and brown people must not be tolerated. and in particular if you're a white person reading this, put your body on the line & fuck passivity. if you're looking for thorough & reliable reporting regarding what's been going on, refer to <a class="link1" href="https://twitter.com/AshAgony?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">ash j's twitter account</a> and paypal him for the incredibly important work that he does.
